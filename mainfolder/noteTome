so apparently gotta fix these stuff : 


Bring in the ‚Äúcore math‚Äù from the big script into your util.py.

Functions like normalize_index, parallel_cor_function, series_cor_function, make_ac_vector, make_cc_vector can live in util.py.

Your rna_features.py can then just call them.

Implement the missing 3‚Äì6 methods properly in rna_features.py.
For example:

from util import make_pseknc_vector, make_ac_vector, make_cc_vector

def psednc_matrix(seqs, props, lam, w=0.05, return_format="matrix", sample_ids=None):
    vecs = make_pseknc_vector(seqs, lam, w, k=2, phyche_value=props)
    cols = [f"PseDNC_{i}" for i in range(len(vecs[0]))]
    return cols, vecs


Do the same for DAC, DCC, DACC using make_ac_vector / make_cc_vector.

Drop sys.argv / CLI logic.

That‚Äôs useful for standalone command-line tools, but since you‚Äôre aiming to run ML pipelines in Jupyter, keep everything as functions.

FASTA input.

Right now your rna_features.py assumes seqs is just a list of strings. The old code uses FASTA reading. Decide whether you want both options:

Option A: keep only seqs: list[str] ‚Üí simplest for ML.

Option B: add a from_fasta(filename) helper that calls your existing functions.

üöÄ My Recommendation

Stick with your current modular code (rna_features.py + util.py), but borrow the missing math logic from the big script to implement methods 3‚Äì6.
That way:

You stay clean & Jupyter-friendly.

You cover all 12 RNA feature types.

You don‚Äôt rely on a giant monolithic script with sys.argv.

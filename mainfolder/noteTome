# so apparently gotta fix these stuff : 


#     """"
#     so apparently the previous code of the github is better than my code in below mentioned ways (volgens chatgpt) , idk what it means but gotta comeback to it : 


#       Completeness: The giant script implements the missing methods you pointed out earlier — especially PseDNC, DAC, DCC, DACC (3–6 in your table). In your current rna_features.py, those are just raise NotImplementedError(...).

#     Phyche index handling: It has support for reading a CSV (phy.csv) of physicochemical properties, normalizing them, and applying them in PseDNC/DAC/DCC/DACC. Your version doesn’t yet include that.

#     Multiple modes (series vs parallel factors): The big one allows both parallel and series correlation factors for PseDNC, while your version is simplified.-> what  is gonna happen parrallel i'm so confused? oh wait nvm 
#     """








# Bring in the “core math” from the big script into your util.py.

# Functions like normalize_index, parallel_cor_function, series_cor_function, make_ac_vector, make_cc_vector can live in util.py.

# Your rna_features.py can then just call them.

# Implement the missing 3–6 methods properly in rna_features.py.
# For example:

# from util import make_pseknc_vector, make_ac_vector, make_cc_vector

# def psednc_matrix(seqs, props, lam, w=0.05, return_format="matrix", sample_ids=None):
#     vecs = make_pseknc_vector(seqs, lam, w, k=2, phyche_value=props)
#     cols = [f"PseDNC_{i}" for i in range(len(vecs[0]))]
#     return cols, vecs


# Do the same for DAC, DCC, DACC using make_ac_vector / make_cc_vector.

# Drop sys.argv / CLI logic.

# That’s useful for standalone command-line tools, but since you’re aiming to run ML pipelines in Jupyter, keep everything as functions.

# FASTA input.

# Right now your rna_features.py assumes seqs is just a list of strings. The old code uses FASTA reading. Decide whether you want both options:

# Option A: keep only seqs: list[str] → simplest for ML.

# Option B: add a from_fasta(filename) helper that calls your existing functions.

# 🚀 My Recommendation

# Stick with your current modular code (rna_features.py + util.py), but borrow the missing math logic from the big script to implement methods 3–6.
# That way:

# You stay clean & Jupyter-friendly.

# You cover all 12 RNA feature types.

# You don’t rely on a giant monolithic script with sys.argv.


# 1.Data  w pandas 
# 2. loading data 
# 3. arc parse it's gonna be a class iself then i call it in the main 
# 4. feature extractor will cordinate 

#i gotta use grtoup by for the all data file  based on the id -> from id and dis i gotta find sequences 
#group by funciont in pandas
